# Figma plugin

Hack day project; subject to change and a good refactor.

---

Generates CSS variables for both light and dark themes from Figma tokens.
Also generates a JavaScript object with references to these variables which can
be used for a typed theming system for CSS-in-JS libraries like
`styled-components` or `emotion`.
